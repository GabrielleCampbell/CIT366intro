				<p>I'm an Information techology major with a minor in Women and Gender studies. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. I currently work part time for Educational Media at the New York City Campus. I'm also a Logistic Intern at the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Fun fact about me is I volunteer every Sunday at a soup kitchen. There is no better feeling that giving back! I also really love dogs... I have 5 in my house but really only 2 are mine.</p>

				<p> I am expected to graduate in May of 2019. I am taking this class to learn more code and become better at it. So far I have helped create a website for a non-profit that should launch offically next month. 
				</p>

				<h2>Goals</h2>
			
				<p>My plan for the future is to work closely with non-profits. I have been debating about persuing my Masters. But who knows what the future will really hold for me. My focus is to mainly in web design and digital Media. Eventually I want to start my own non-profit.
